## 2026-03-11 - [Optimize Analytics Dashboard DB Latency]
**Learning:** The dashboard previously ran 8 distinct database queries sequentially to gather data for the dashboard stats. Drizzle ORM array-based queries are independent and don't rely on previous DB data in this function. Using a `Promise.all` allows these to execute concurrently, fundamentally changing the performance profile from sum-latency to max-latency.
**Action:** Always identify sequential Drizzle SQL calls that do not rely on previous queries. By wrapping independent fetches in `Promise.all`, network round-trips to Cloudflare D1 are parallelized, minimizing performance bottleneck.

## 2026-03-12 - [Batch N+1 Drizzle ORM Queries]
**Learning:** While `Promise.all` is great for parallelizing independent queries, using `Promise.all` with a `.map()` to iterate over records and fetch child relations causes massive N+1 connection/network latency on Cloudflare D1.
**Action:** Always extract IDs from a parent array and use a single batch `inArray()` Drizzle DB fetch to gather relations. Group and process the results in-memory rather than relying on thousands of simultaneous asynchronous connections.## 2026-03-19 - [Combine Drizzle SQL lookups on same table]
**Learning:** When retrieving different attributes from the same record across different utility queries (e.g., pulling `planType` in one function and `monthlyVisitorCount` in another), sequential queries compound Cloudflare D1 latency.
**Action:** Always inspect sequential backend fetches to see if they target the exact same table and same `where` clause. If they do, combine them into a single Drizzle `select` to radically reduce database network latency.

## 2024-06-28 - N+1 Mitigation with SQLite Bare Columns
**Learning:** In Drizzle ORM mapped to Cloudflare D1 (SQLite), avoiding N+1 loops using `Promise.all` can be tricky because standard `.having` filtering is unsupported for row extraction, and `db.batch()` lacks local `better-sqlite3` compatibility. However, SQLite natively supports returning "bare columns" when paired with an aggregate like `MAX()`, allowing efficient cross-environment query batching.
**Action:** When refactoring mapped `Promise.all` selects, explicitly fetch a bare column alongside an aggregate max value mapped to a `GROUP BY` column to safely collapse N roundtrips into a single $O(1)$ query without triggering SQLite errors.
